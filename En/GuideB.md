# SECTION B – WRITING LANGUAGE, FORM, AND STRUCTURE

## WRITING IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN FRENCH
At the Université de Montréal, dissertations and theses must normally be written in French. Exceptions are possible based on the language in which the student completed their previous studies or based on the objectives of the student's program of study and research (RP-ESP, sections 88 and 135). Students who deem it appropriate to request authorization to write their dissertation or thesis in a language other than French must comply with the following standards:

### REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION TO WRITING IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN FRENCH

* Given the importance of the quality of the language in which they are written, students whose first language is not French, or who have completed most of their previous studies at a non-French-speaking university, may be authorized to write their dissertation or thesis in a language other than French. If granted, this authorization implies that all chapters of the work may be written in a language other than French.
* A dissertation or thesis manuscript with articles is considered written in French if all parts other than the articles are written in French. For example, when the articles are written in English, the student must write the abstract and the other chapters surrounding the articles in French. All students must consider this possibility when submitting their arguments in support of a request for authorization to write their dissertation or thesis in a language other than French.
* In certain fields, such as those that focus on language, the research topic could be further enhanced if the student wrote their work in the language directly concerned. In this case, the Dean of the relevant faculty may, if they deem it appropriate, allow the student to write their dissertation or thesis in a language other than French, based on the advice of the program director and if they believe it is realistic to be able to form a committee fluent in both the research topic and the language in which it will be written.
* A reasoned request, supported by the research director, must be submitted to the program director.

## FORM AND STRUCTURE OF THE DISSERTATION OR THESIS
The master's thesis or doctoral thesis is normally presented in the form of a manuscript composed primarily of text, very often accompanied by tables of statistical data and illustrations (photos, images, figures, diagrams, graphs, etc.). Traditionally, the dissertation or thesis manuscript is constructed in monographic form, presenting itself as a coherent whole and intended to be consulted in its entirety. For many years now, particularly in the fields of pure, formal, and medical sciences, manuscripts have been constructed by collecting a certain number of elements (generally scientific articles intended for publication in scholarly journals), each of which can be consulted separately. The coherence of this type of manuscript is normally ensured by introductory, general discussion, and conclusion chapters. In some disciplines, the article-based format has almost entirely supplanted "traditional" composition and has become the norm, hence the decision to avoid using the terms "classical" or "traditional" to describe these forms of dissertations or theses.

In addition to textual content, other types of research-based content may comprise all or part of a thesis or dissertation, including: still or animated images, maps, models, computer programs and code, a website, notated music, audio elements (performed music, narrations, etc.), raw digital data, etc. Furthermore, in some professional or artistic fields, textual content does not necessarily take the form of monograph chapters or scientific articles; other types of documents (reports, business plans, literary essays, public policy briefs, field notes, exegesis, etc.) may constitute all or part of the thesis or dissertation. We will therefore be presenting two other forms of dissertations and theses that may be considered acceptable within our institution: thesis or dissertation file and the thesis or dissertation creation.

Students should be aware that the jury will evaluate these forms of dissertation or thesis using the same criteria as those used for the evaluation of a manuscript composed primarily of textual elements: namely, the completion of a structured and rigorous research project that demonstrates, in the case of a master's degree, that the candidate has research skills and is able to present the results of their work well, and in the case of a doctoral degree, that they make a significant contribution to the advancement of knowledge in a field.

For the preparation of dissertations or theses by article or containing non-textual elements, the student must have previously received authorization from their research supervisor and the program director and have verified with the libraries the terms and conditions for depositing in Papyrus.

### Monographic Dissertation or Thesis
This form of dissertation or thesis presentation, often referred to as "classic" or "traditional," takes the form of a monograph (book) divided into distinct chapters. The entire work forms a coherent, linear whole, with the chapters not necessarily constructed to be read independently of one another. The classic composition of a monographic thesis or dissertation generally (but not necessarily) includes, in this order, the following chapters: introduction, literature review, methodology, presentation and analysis of results, general discussion, and conclusion.

However, this composition may vary depending on disciplinary and cultural traditions or the research plan adopted by the student. The monographic format is flexible and promotes an integrated presentation of the student's work. Subsequent steps may be taken to publish the dissertation or thesis, either in its entirety as a book with a publisher, or in sections as scientific articles in appropriate outlets, the latter sometimes even being published before the submission of the final version of the manuscript.

### Dissertation or Thesis by Articles
In a dissertation or thesis by articles, the main results are presented in the form of articles published in scientific journals or in the form of manuscripts submitted or ready to be submitted for publication. Like monographic theses and dissertations, the articles are generally composed primarily of text, often accompanied by visual elements. To present a thesis or dissertation by articles, the articles must have been written during the student's studies, as part of the training program. Under no circumstances will the articles have been written or published before admission to the program.

This form of presentation aims to facilitate and accelerate the dissemination of research results. This approach also provides students with the opportunity to learn how to design and write articles, according to the procedures and criteria specific to their field of research, and to plan their work accordingly.

A mixed presentation of research results, including articles and regular chapters, is also acceptable. Care should be taken to ensure that the rules applying to articles integrated into the dissertation or thesis are strictly adhered to. However, under no circumstances should the thesis or dissertation be composed exclusively of articles. An introductory chapter and a concluding discussion chapter are essential to give coherence to the manuscript as a whole.

Students should be aware that the presentation of a dissertation or thesis in articles requires compliance with the same formal and substantive requirements as the monographic presentation format. As for the evaluation of the work, the student should know that the jury evaluating the dissertation or thesis must judge a manuscript in the form of articles by applying the same criteria as those which govern the evaluation of a manuscript in monographic form, that is to say by evaluating the real contribution of the student to the production of research results and their presentation in the form of a well-synthesized work. The writing of a dissertation or thesis by articles is subject to the following general rules which aim to ensure the quality and uniformity of this mode of presentation.

## GENERAL RULES
* Ideally, a dissertation or thesis should include articles for which the student is the principal author, which most often means the sole or first author. As principal author, the student must have made a significant, essential, and decisive contribution to the article. Exceptionally, when the importance of an article warrants it, it may be included in the work, even if the student is not the sole principal author, provided that the student is one of the principal authors. Note that a book chapter cannot be considered an article in a dissertation or thesis.

* To be included in the final manuscript, an article may have been published, have been submitted for publication, or be in the form of a manuscript ready for submission to a specific journal, but only if it corresponds to work carried out during the student's active training. An article published prior to admission to the program will not be considered under any circumstances.

* Given the varying merit of articles and the specific requirements of different fields of knowledge, there is no absolute rule regarding the minimum or maximum number of articles required for a dissertation or thesis. Based on experience with this format, it is reasonable to assume that one substantial and valuable article, with the student as the first or principal author, might be sufficient for a master's thesis, while two or three such articles would be required for a doctoral thesis. However, it is more judicious to consider the amount of work involved in writing the article(s). For example, a single article with a major impact can, in some disciplines, represent four to five years of work. Therefore, whether for a dissertation or a thesis, the student must have his request for writing articles approved by describing his contribution to the manuscripts, since ultimately it is the jury who will judge whether the contribution is satisfactory or whether additions are required.

## RULES APPLICABLE WHEN WRITING THE MANUSCRIPT
* Articles included in the dissertation or thesis may be written in a language other than French, depending on the journal for which they are submitted. Submitting a dissertation or thesis does not require authorization to write articles in a language other than French when all sections other than the articles and the English abstract are written in French. The manuscript is considered written in a language other than French only when all chapters are written in that other language, including those that are not articles per se.

* For each article for which the student is not the sole author, it is important to obtain the consent of the co-authors before including the article in the dissertation or thesis. To this end, students can use the form available in the Graduate Studies section of the MonUdeM platform and should keep it for future reference.

* The student must explicitly state their original, independent, and specific contribution to each co-authored article and appropriately comment on the role played by all co-authors. It is recommended that this information be provided on a separate page preceding each article or in the introductory chapter of the dissertation or thesis.

* The dissertation or thesis must constitute a well-integrated and coherent whole. To this end, articles must be preceded by an introductory section and generally followed by a general discussion and a conclusion. Articles must be presented in the same format as the rest of the text and not in the publisher's formatted version.

## Procedure for requesting authorization to submit a dissertation or thesis by article
When considering submitting a dissertation or thesis by article, the student must first secure the agreement and support of their supervisor. They must then seek the opinion of the program director (or a member of the Graduate Studies Committee if the program director has a conflict of interest) on whether or not to choose this method of presentation. As the program director, the program director must determine whether the method of presentation by article will meet the quality standards and scientific communication practices of the field of study. They must also anticipate, as much as possible, potential conflicts regarding the sharing of intellectual property between the student and the other authors of the articles included in the dissertation or thesis and ensure that the student has obtained the consent of the co-authors for the dissemination of this document.

To be considered for a request for authorization to write articles, the research work must be sufficiently advanced to allow for a reasonable clarification of the content of the articles and their authors, as well as the general organization of the entire dissertation or thesis manuscript. Such a request, stating the agreement of the research supervisor and stipulating that the rules regarding the format of presentation by articles will be respected, must be submitted to the program director, who will then decide whether or not to grant authorization. It should be noted that authorization to write articles may be withdrawn if the monitoring and evaluation of the program reveals that the student is unable to meet the requirements of this format.

Given that the request for authorization to write articles must be submitted before the final drafting stage of the dissertation or thesis, some articles may still be in preparation at the time of the request. This situation does not prevent authorization from being granted. A list of elements to be specified in the request for drafting by articles is provided in Appendix A.

## PREREQUISITES FOR WRITING ARTICLES
* After providing information regarding their program, students must list the articles to be included in their master's or doctoral thesis. For each article, they must indicate the order of authors, the title, the journal for which the article is normally submitted, and the current status of each article (published, submitted, or ready for submission). Students must clearly indicate how they plan to apply the general rules for writing articles.

* The research supervisor must provide their written opinion on the proposed writing of the dissertation or thesis in articles, providing appropriate comments on the information provided by the student.

* The program director or, where applicable, their representative, must make a written decision on the request for authorization to write articles.

### Dissertation or thesis portfolio
Less conventional than the previous two, this form of dissertation and thesis is sometimes referred to as a portfolio or hybrid. It consists of an assembly of autonomous elements, often professional in nature, resulting from a thoughtful and rigorous approach, forming a whole whose coherence is ensured by a unifying cross-cutting theme. To achieve this, it is essential to include an introductory section presenting a coherent overview of the research (research objectives, review of relevant literature, scientific approach, etc.) as well as a concluding discussion section. A presentation of the documents in the portfolio will guide the reader through the various elements, which may be in non-textual form and do not necessarily need to be consulted in a linear fashion. The thesis or dissertation portfolio is a relatively new format, but it is increasingly used in professional doctoral programs and in fields such as planning, applied humanities, and management and administration sciences. As with the article format, it is essential to first present a general plan in order to obtain the approval of the research supervisor and program director to present one's dissertation or thesis in this format from the outset.

Students choosing this format should be aware that the production process may require technical challenges during the compilation of the dossier, particularly for the non-textual elements contained within it. Furthermore, some elements may require the use of specific devices for consultation depending on the format (particularly for members of the jury during evaluation).

While not exhaustive, the following is a list of elements that may be included in a dissertation or thesis dossier:

* Reports and policy statements.
* Inventions, models, prototypes, business plans, patents, technology licenses.
* Educational programs, course materials, assessment tools. * Creative works and archives from festivals, exhibitions, cultural or artistic events.
* Various digital artifacts.

## Creative Dissertation or Thesis
This format is generally suitable for a thesis or dissertation in the arts or stemming from a research-creation approach (music, literary creation, film, television, video games, media arts, etc.). The body of these dissertations or theses is composed of one or more creative works, generally accompanied by a text.

This type of thesis can also be applied in more technical fields, where the fundamental element of the research is a product, for example, the creation of a computer application, a video game, the development of an algorithm, or an invention made during the course of the research.

A creative thesis or dissertation could take various forms, including the following:
– A literary work (various types).
– An archive.
– A database.
– An exhibition.
– A website.
– A 3D model.
– A geolocated tour. – A visual or sound installation.
– A documentary or fiction film.
– A web film or web series.
– A video or transmedia game.
– An immersive work.
– An augmented reality work.
