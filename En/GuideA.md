# SECTION A – RESEARCH CONTEXT IN A GRADUATE PROGRAM
## GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Students enrolled in a graduate research training program are expected to develop research skills and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. Research-based master's programs, typically lasting 45 credits, aim to introduce students to the practice of research so that they can properly use documentary sources and apply investigative and analytical methods appropriate to a given problem. Students must report on the results of their work in a substantial writing exercise, usually worth between 18 and 30 credits, referred to as a dissertation. Doctoral programs typically last 90 credits and aim to develop students' ability to independently complete original research that will be presented in a thesis and disseminated appropriately. A very significant number of credits (varying from 60 to 90 depending on the program) are awarded for the completion of the thesis.
Students enrolled in a master's or doctoral program are subject to the Academic Regulations for Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (RP-ESP), which set out the minimum standards for regulating student progress regarding the preparation, writing, and, above all, the evaluation of the dissertation and thesis. These standards govern their evaluation.

## MINIMUM STANDARDS — MASTER'S DEGREE
"A dissertation is the completion of a structured and rigorous research project in a specific field that allows the student to improve their knowledge in their field of study. The master's thesis must demonstrate that the candidate has research skills and is able to effectively write and present the results of their work." — RP-ESP, art. 1.17.

More specifically, the dissertation evaluation must consider the following elements:
* The candidate's research aptitude as demonstrated by the dissertation.
* The ability to conduct critical syntheses.
* Contribution to the advancement of knowledge.
* The quality of the written language.
* The quality of the material and typographical presentation.
* The overall quality of the work (title, abstract, etc.).

## MINIMUM STANDARDS — DOCTORATE
"A doctoral thesis is the result of in-depth and original research by the student. It must demonstrate research that makes a significant contribution to the advancement of knowledge." — RP-ESP, art. 1.26.

More explicitly, thesis evaluation must consider the following elements:
* Genuine research autonomy as demonstrated by the thesis and the defense.
* A significant and important contribution to the advancement of knowledge.
* The quality of the content and form (work plan, methods used, results and demonstrations, argumentative development, bibliography).
* The quality of the written language.
* The quality of the material and typographical presentation.
* The overall quality of the work (title, abstract, etc.).

## INTELLECTUAL PROBITY AND RESEARCH ETHICS

At the Université de Montréal, all individuals involved in teaching and research are required to adhere to strict standards of intellectual probity, research ethics, and to comply with the regulations on conflicts of interest. The Université de Montréal's Policy on Responsible Conduct of Research sets out "the fundamental values ​​and principles underlying responsible conduct of research and the resulting best practices," as well as the general rules of scientific honesty. The policy applies to "all individuals conducting research under the auspices of the University, including, among others, lecturers, researchers, students, fund managers, research staff, postdoctoral fellows, and professors." Students are also required to comply with the Regulations for students, fund managers, research staff, postdoctoral fellows, and professors. Students are also required to comply with the Disciplinary Regulations on Plagiarism or Fraud Concerning Graduate Students.

The Université de Montréal's policies regarding research involving human subjects retain the general rules of ethics developed by organizations mandated for this purpose by the federal government and entrust their application to a University Ethics Committee that oversees several sectoral committees. This ensures that professors and researchers, as well as graduate students, apply appropriate general rules of ethics in their work involving human subjects (see also the website on responsible conduct in research). In this type of research, approval of the ethical dimension of the student's research project used for the dissertation or thesis is required, as indicated on the research topic registration form.

Regarding the use of animals in research, the Université de Montréal has adopted the principles and guidelines contained in the Canadian Council on Animal Care guide.

Finally, intellectual property extends to "any product resulting from intellectual or creative activity, regardless of its material form, and to which rights conferred by law apply." This may include experimental data, new concepts, methods, or models, literary or artistic works, or simply novel know-how. The legal principles arising from intellectual property essentially focus on the equitable sharing of benefits associated with research results between the individuals and institutions involved. When it lends itself to legal considerations, intellectual property in academia may be protected by copyright or a patent. On the specific issue of copyright, the guide produced by the Libraries Branch is an essential reference, particularly for students engaged in a research program that will culminate in the writing of a dissertation or thesis.

Regarding research conducted by students as part of a dissertation or thesis, the Université de Montréal's Intellectual Property Policy states the following:

#### INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

* When a student participates in a professor's research, they have access to the work of any kind in which they have actually participated, whether their contribution was substantial or merely supplementary. If they are the sole author, creator, or inventor, they may use it for their dissertation or thesis, with or without modifications or additions. If they are not the sole author, creator, or inventor, the results of the work may only be used in accordance with the rules of the ESP (theses and dissertations by articles).

* When the student's participation occurs outside of an employment contract, whether without compensation or with compensation (e.g., a grant), the communication, publication, and commercialization of the work by the professor must be done with the student's agreement when the latter's contribution is recognized as substantial under the framework agreement (or a specific agreement).

The sharing of intellectual property in research results varies depending on the respective roles of the student and the research supervisor. In the humanities and social sciences, supervision often takes the form of intellectual direction, leaving the student primarily responsible for generating ideas and conducting their own research. The supervisor then acts as a resource person and expert, and more rarely as a full collaborator in the execution of the work. In this case, the student should normally have the first right to the intellectual property of their research. However, in the natural sciences and health sciences, the usual practice is the collaborative formula involving a group of researchers (research supervisor, students, postdoctoral fellows, technicians). In this model, the research supervisor is normally the one who provided the general idea guiding the group's research, as well as the resources required to support and conduct this research. The supervisor will usually make decisions regarding the sharing of intellectual property rights relating to collaborative work, based on specific agreements between the various participants.
