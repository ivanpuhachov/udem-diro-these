# SECTION E – EVALUATION OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The evaluation process begins when the student submits their dissertation or thesis submission notice.

The steps in the process are not identical for master's and doctoral programs, but certain basic principles apply to both study cycles. The evaluation is the institution's responsibility. It is conducted collegially by a jury and must be competent, impartial, rewarding, and public. It is important to emphasize the very important issues that characterize the evaluation process for dissertations and theses: the application of equivalent quality standards to all fields of study, fairness to students, who are entitled to a rigorous and fair evaluation of their work, and the credibility of the evaluation process itself.

## FORMATION OF DISSERTATION AND THESIS JURIES
The department head or, in the case of non-departmentalized faculties, the dean of the faculty, proposes names of individuals, on the form provided for this purpose, to form dissertation and thesis juries. In all cases, the department head must ensure that these individuals have sufficient knowledge of the student's field of research to be able to adequately evaluate their work. The department head must also ensure that participation in the dissertation or thesis jury does not create a conflict of interest, or even that there is no appearance of one.

In the case of departmentalized faculties, the dean appoints the jury. In the case of non-departmentalized faculties, the appointment is made by the Associate Vice-Rector for Graduate Studies.

## COMPOSITION OF THE DISSERTATION JURY
For a master's thesis, the jury is composed of three members, or four if there is co-supervision.
6 The typical composition is as follows:
* Chairperson-rapporteur (ideally a full professor at the Université de Montréal).
* Research supervisor and co-supervisor (if applicable).
* Jury member (internal or external to the University).

## COMPOSITION OF THE THESIS JURY
The jury for a doctoral thesis is composed of four members, or five if there is co-supervision.
6 The typical composition is as follows:
* Chairperson-rapporteur (ideally a full professor at the Université de Montréal).
* Research supervisor and co-supervisor (if applicable).
* Jury member (internal or external to the University).
* External examiner.

For the sole privileged moment of the thesis defense, a representative of the dean is appointed.

> 6. "In the case where the student is supervised by a supervisor and a co-supervisor (or co-supervisors), only one vote is counted in a vote by which they must decide on an aspect of the student's education." — RP-ESP, art. 86 and 131

## COMPOSITION OF THE JOURNAL FOR A CO-SUPERVISED THESIS
The composition of the jury for a co-supervised thesis varies depending on the location of the defense and generally includes a larger number of people, if only because the candidate has two research supervisors and each university appoints at least one member of the jury. The location of the defense and the composition of the jury must generally be specified in advance in the co-supervision agreement for each student pursuing their doctorate under this special regime.

## FUNCTIONS OF THE JURION MEMBERS
The main functions of the various members of the dissertation and thesis juries are as follows:

### Chairperson-Reviewer
The chairperson-reviewer is a member of the jury and, as such, participates like the other members in the evaluation of the dissertation or thesis, but also has specific responsibilities. This person officially communicates with the faculty and consults with them if there are any questions about the procedure. They convene the jury meetings, write the reports, and ensure that these reports accurately reflect the deliberations. When a thesis jury defense is held, the chairperson oversees its organization and convenes the members (including the dean's representative). They preside over the meeting as well as the final deliberations of the jury and ensure that everything complies with established practices and protocol.
Finally, they inform the student of the results of the deliberations.

### Research Supervisor (and Co-Supervisor, if applicable)
The research supervisor is a member of the evaluation jury and, as such, must be impartial and rigorous. Furthermore, given their supervisory role over the student, they are required to make a judgment on the activities in which they have participated. Indeed, in many cases, they have participated in their student's research and may even have made it their own, to the point of being associated with certain resulting publications. It is common, in the way the dissertation or thesis is presented in articles, for them to have co-authored the texts. Consequently, such circumstances lead the research supervisor to view the evaluation of the dissertation or thesis, at least partially, as an assessment of their own work. It is therefore of the utmost importance, in such cases, that the supervisor be able to maintain the necessary distance from their student for an objective and impartial evaluation.

### Jury Member
The jury member is neither the student's supervisor, nor the chair of the jury, nor an external examiner. Their role is to provide a conscientious evaluation of the dissertation or thesis. Like the external examiner, this person, whether internal or external to UdeM, must be well qualified to judge the content of the document, and in this regard, their contribution to the evaluation is of great importance. They must be chosen based on the same principles of impartiality and competence as the external examiner. In the case of dissertations, their role is particularly important given the absence of such an examiner.

### External Examiner
The external examiner is a recognized expert in the student's field of research. They come from another institution and have no working relationship with the community, the professors, and researchers involved in the student's training, or with the student themselves. The external examiner is the only member of the jury required by procedure to produce a detailed written report on the student's thesis and to award a commendation on its quality. This report is sent to the chairperson, who will then be able to organize the jury's deliberations. It is not appropriate for the external examiner's report to be communicated to the student.

### Dean's Representative
In the case of theses, the presence of the Dean's Representative at defenses ensures that institutional standards of rigor and decorum are respected and that the same procedures are applied throughout the University. The Dean delegates this responsibility to his or her representative, who attends the defense and the jury's final deliberations. At the Université de Montréal, the Dean's Representative is the only person involved in the thesis evaluation who is not a member of the student's home academic community. He or she thus represents the entire university community and, if necessary, reports to the Dean on his or her observations. However, he or she is not a member of the jury, does not vote, and may not unduly influence the jury's deliberations.

## RESULTS OF THE THESIS JURY'S DELIBERATIONS7
After deliberation, the jury may reach one of the following conclusions:

### A. Unanimous or Majority Acceptance of the Dissertation
A copy of the final report is sent to the VRAESP. The student is authorized to submit their final submission in Papyrus. If applicable, the jury's report highlights the excellence of the dissertation and indicates its ranking among the best in the field; this is one of the main criteria for the student's potential inclusion on the Honor List.

### B. Unanimous or Majority Acceptance of the Dissertation with Minor Corrections
A copy of the jury's preliminary report is sent to the VRAESP. The chair submits to the student the list of corrections requested by the jury. The jury makes the corrections under the supervision of the research supervisor within a maximum of one month. If the corrections have been made to the jury chair's satisfaction, a copy of the jury's final report is sent to the VRAESP and the student is authorized to submit the final version in Papyrus to initiate the degree granting process. If applicable, the jury's report must highlight the excellence of the dissertation and indicate its ranking among the best in the field; this is one of the main criteria for the student's potential inclusion on an honor list.

### C. Unanimous or Majority Request for Major Corrections
The jury does not recommend acceptance of the dissertation and requests major corrections. The deadline for making corrections is set by the jury and must not exceed six months. A copy of the jury's preliminary report is sent to the VRAESP. The unit informs the student in writing of the jury's decision and the deadline for making the requested corrections, a list of which is provided. All copies of the manuscript are returned to the student, except for one, which is retained by the unit. The student may submit their corrected dissertation at any time before the deadline. The corrected dissertation will be re-evaluated following the same protocol by the same jury, which may then:
1. Accept it without requesting corrections. 
2. Accept it with a request for corrections (minor only).
3. Reject it.

### D. Unanimous or Majority Rejection of the Dissertation
This recommendation from the jury terminates the candidacy. A copy of the final report is sent to the VRAESP and the dean of the relevant faculty. The jury's report must clearly explain the reasons for the dissertation's rejection. The dean officially informs the student of the termination of their candidacy. All copies of the manuscript are returned to the student, except for one, which is retained by the department. The student may not appeal the jury's decision.

## RESULTS OF THE THESIS JURY DELIBERATIONS8
### First Jury
After deliberation, the first jury may reach one of the following conclusions regarding the defense:

#### A. Unanimous Acceptance of the Dissertation
The chair of the jury takes steps to organize the defense.

#### B. Majority Acceptance of the Thesis
A defense is not recommended, but the student has the right to request a defense. Students should be aware, however, that the jury's decision, after the defense, must be unanimous at the first jury (RP-ESP, art. 139C). If they hope to have their thesis accepted, they must therefore convince all members of the jury of the merit of their thesis during the defense. Depending on the student's decision, one of two actions will be taken:

1. If the student does not exercise their right to a defense, the dean will appoint a second jury (see the Second Jury section below) to review the thesis. 

2. If the student exercises his or her right to defend the thesis, the president of the jury will take the necessary steps to organize the event, having clearly informed the student that in this case, if he or she does not obtain a unanimous acceptance verdict during the defense, his or her candidacy will end.

#### C. Unanimous Acceptance of the Thesis with Minor Corrections
A copy of the jury's preliminary report is sent to the VRAESP (Research and Development Unit). The chair submits the list of corrections requested by the jury to the student. The student makes the corrections under the supervision of the research supervisor within a maximum of one month. If the corrections have been made to the jury chair's satisfaction, the latter takes the necessary steps to organize the defense.

#### D. Unanimous or Majority Request for Major Corrections
The jury does not recommend a defense and requests major corrections. The deadline for making corrections is set by the jury and must not exceed one year. A copy of the jury's preliminary report is sent to the VRAESP and the dean of the relevant faculty. The unit informs the student in writing of the jury's decision and the deadline for making the requested corrections, a list of which is provided. All copies of the manuscript are returned to the student, except for one, which is retained by the department. The student may submit their corrected thesis at any time before the deadline. The corrected thesis will be evaluated again following the same protocol by the same committee, which may then:
1. Recommend defense without requesting corrections.
2. Recommend defense with requesting corrections (minor only).
3. Reject it.

#### E. Majority Rejection of the Thesis or Tie
A copy of the defense recommendation form is sent to the VRAESP and the dean of the relevant faculty. The chair must provide the reasons for the rejection and dissent, or, in the event of a tie, the reasons for the committee's decision. The dean will inform the student of the committee's decision and will normally appoint a second committee (see the Second Committee section below), which will resume evaluating the thesis.

#### F. Unanimous Rejection of the Thesis
A copy of the defense recommendation form is sent to the VRAESP and the dean of the relevant faculty. The chair must provide the reasons for the thesis rejection. The dean of the relevant faculty will officially inform the student of the termination of their application. All copies of the manuscript are returned to the student, except for one, which is retained by the relevant department. The student may not appeal the jury's decision.

### Second Jury
A second jury is formed before the defense in two cases:

* Following a majority acceptance of the thesis by the first jury and when the student does not exercise their right to request a defense, or

* Following a majority rejection or rejection of the thesis by a tie vote by the first jury.

The second jury will review the thesis in its entirety (as submitted at the time of the initial submission) and will proceed in the same way as the first jury, but its decisions will be recognized by a majority vote rather than unanimously. In the event of a tie, and only in this circumstance, the vote of the chair of the second jury will be decisive. A majority acceptance of the thesis by a second jury must be followed by the defense. A majority rejection of the thesis will result in the termination of the candidacy.

## THE THESIS DEFENSE
The chair of the thesis committee, whether for the first or second committee, must ensure that the procedures described in this section are properly carried out.

Following the committee's decision to recommend a defense, the chair will proceed with organizing the defense. To this end, the chair must take into account two important factors:
* Consider the availability of the internal committee members, the external examiner, the dean's representative, and the student in order to properly schedule the defense. In certain exceptional cases, the external examiner may be unable to attend the defense; the relevant faculty may then appoint a representative, normally a professor attached to the student's program, who may ask the candidate the questions prepared by the external examiner. 
* Send the completed and signed thesis recommendation form to the relevant faculty no later than ten business days before the scheduled defense date, along with a copy of the thesis for the Dean's representative.

During the defense, the Chair-Reporter invites the student to present their thesis and answer questions from the committee members and the Dean's representative, if applicable. If deemed appropriate, the Chair of the Committee may allow other attendees to ask questions. In consultation with the Dean's representative, the Chair of the Committee ensures that the defense is conducted in accordance with the established procedures and with appropriate standards of rigor and decorum.

The Chair-Reporter presides over the deliberations following the defense, in the presence of the Dean's representative, who acts as guarantor of the integrity of the procedure. The chairperson-rapporteur is also responsible for drafting the jury's final report and informing the student of the results of the evaluation following the defense. They must also ensure that the jury's report notes, where applicable, the excellence of the thesis and indicates whether it ranks among the best in the field; this is one of the main criteria for the student's potential inclusion on the Honor List and for the possible submission of the work to Best Thesis Award competitions.

The jury, after the defense, may reach one of the following conclusions:

#### A. Unanimous acceptance of the thesis
A copy of the final report is sent to the VRAESP. The student is then authorized to submit the final version of the manuscript in Papyrus to initiate the degree granting process.

#### B. Non-unanimous acceptance or majority rejection of the thesis
First jury. A copy of the final report is sent to the VRAESP and the dean of the relevant faculty.

Copies of the manuscript are returned to the student, except for one, which is retained by the department. The dean then normally appoints a second panel to review the thesis.

Second panel. A copy of the final report is sent to the VRAESP and the dean of the relevant faculty.

The dean officially informs the student of the termination of their application in the event of a majority rejection. Copies of the manuscript are returned to the student, except for one, which is retained by the department.

#### C. Unanimous Rejection of the Thesis
A copy of the final report is sent to the VRAESP and the dean of the relevant faculty. The dean officially informs the student of the termination of their application. All copies of the manuscript are returned to them, except for one, which is retained by the department. The student may not appeal the jury's decision.

## FINAL REPORT
The final report of the dissertation or thesis jury is a document that gathers important information about the manuscript being evaluated, information that may have significant consequences for the candidate's academic future. It must therefore be completed carefully, and we would like to draw attention to three of its particularly sensitive components.

#### Classification of the Dissertation or Thesis
In point 1 of the central box of the form, the jury members are asked to classify the dissertation or thesis on a four-point scale ranging from "exceptional" to "good."

This is a similar ranking to that regularly used by professors who sit on grant or scholarship application panels for major funding agencies. Given the diversity of disciplinary fields and their specific approaches, it is difficult to define the points on this scale. For illustrative purposes, and in no way limiting, it is possible to identify a few broad criteria that form the basis for evaluating dissertations and theses in all disciplinary sectors:

1) Quality of the material presentation and relevance of the manuscript's organization.
2) Quality of the language.
3) Degree of extension and integration in the review of scientific literature.
4) Relevance and precision of the question posed in the dissertation or thesis.
5) Adequacy of the chosen theoretical framework.
6) Relevance of the methods used.
7) Quality of the discussion of the results obtained. 
8) Innovative aspects of the dissertation or thesis.
9) Overall intellectual contribution to the field of research.

Taking into account the different expectations for master's and doctoral degrees, a thesis or dissertation rated as "exceptional" by the jury members should be impeccable in the first seven criteria and clearly distinguish themselves in the last two, including significant innovative aspects and a tangible intellectual contribution to the candidate's field of research.

Recommendation for Competitions and the Honor List

In point 2 of the central box of the form, the jury members are asked whether they consider it appropriate to recommend the dissertation or thesis for possible submission by the institution to competitions for the Best Dissertation or Thesis Prizes, and whether they believe the candidate should be considered for inclusion on the Honor List.

This information is important. Competitions for the Prizes are generally very selective, and the institution may only submit a few applications per disciplinary sector, sometimes even just one. In this context, it is therefore imperative to be able to identify the manuscripts that stand out the most at the master's and doctoral levels. The Honor List only accepts a maximum of 10% of graduates from our graduate programs. While the cumulative academic average is taken into consideration (a minimum academic average of 4.000 is required), the ranking of the dissertation or thesis and the committee's recommendation for admission are also determining factors.

Unless specific considerations are raised by the committee members, which should be made explicit, only dissertations or theses classified as "exceptional" or "excellent" should receive a favorable recommendation for these two questions.

### Summary Report and Jury Comments
It is always desirable for the final report of the dissertation or thesis committee to include a commentary summarizing, even if only briefly, the main aspects of the deliberations and the comments made on the dissertation or thesis.

However, it is essential to produce a much more detailed report in cases where the committee members dissent. Likewise, it is important to provide substantial justification for the reasons that led the jury members to reject a dissertation or thesis.

In the case of defenses by students under a joint supervision program, it is important to comply with the partner institution's requirements regarding defense reports. In France in particular, these are of great importance, especially if the doctoral student plans to pursue an academic career. Therefore, in these cases, the jury is expected to produce a more substantial defense report.

Finally, it is also important to present the arguments that led the jury members to classify the dissertation or thesis as "exceptional" or "excellent." This approach is even more important in the case of dissertations, where there is no written report from the external examiner, and where the institution only has the final report to understand the classification proposed by the jury members.
