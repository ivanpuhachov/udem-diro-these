# SECTION D – SUBMISSION OF THE DISSERTATION OR THESIS

## REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMITTING A DISSERTATION OR THESIS
The requirements listed in this section are identified by the letter M if they apply only to master's thesis, by the letter T if they apply only to doctoral thesis, and by the letters MT when they apply to both types of manuscripts.

### MT Prerequisites for Submission Notice
The student must, where applicable, have taken the appropriate steps to obtain authorization to write in articles, to write in a language other than French, and to keep the dissertation or thesis confidential or to defer its dissemination (see the section "Dissemination of Dissertations and Theses" on page 25).

### MT Submission Notice

This notice must be completed two months before the planned submission of the dissertation or thesis. It serves to initiate the jury appointment process. Students should remember that they have previously registered their research topic with the program office, which has been reserved for them for the eventual submission of their dissertation or thesis.

When a student continues to write their dissertation or thesis for submission after a formal interruption of their studies, they must plan for readmission to the program and submit a request to this effect no later than the time they submit a submission notice. Under these conditions, students should be aware that the program director may require them to refresh their knowledge and research work before recommending readmission for submission of their manuscript.

Although readmission for submission is possible, it is highly preferable that the duration of studies be consistent with the maximum academic duration for the master's program (two years for students enrolled full-time) or the doctoral program (five years for students enrolled full-time), excluding suspension and preparation periods (RP-ESP, art. 65 and 112). By complying with these deadlines, students are able to obtain research results that are likely to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their field of study and to write a high-quality dissertation or thesis. Otherwise, the longer they delay submitting their dissertation or thesis, the greater the risk of producing a work that could be deemed inadequate by the jury.

### MT Copyright
If students plan to include significant excerpts from books or articles in their dissertation or thesis, they must obtain written permission to reproduce these excerpts and appropriately acknowledge them in their manuscript. Please note that, beyond textual content, any reproduction of copyrighted material (photographs, illustrations, data tables, maps and plans, scores, sound recordings, etc.) in the thesis or dissertation must be made with the consent of the copyright holders of these works. It is therefore necessary to obtain the required permissions before final submission. As this process can be time-consuming, it is strongly recommended to contact the copyright holders early in the drafting process.

### MT Digital Supporting Documents
It is possible to submit electronic documents in addition to the manuscript, provided that the members of the master's or doctoral committee have the necessary equipment to review these documents. However, any student considering such an approach should consult their program advisor beforehand.

### M Initial Dissertation Submission and Related Forms

The initial submission procedure for dissertations is less formalized than that for final submission. However, certain general guidelines must be followed to preserve the adequacy and integrity of the jury's evaluation process.

The initial submission of the dissertation and all related forms must be made to the office of the academic unit responsible for the program in which the student is enrolled. The student must be enrolled in their program at the time of submission. In the rare cases where an initial paper submission is requested, three printed copies (plus a fourth copy if there is a co-supervisor) are required. It is the student's responsibility to print the required number of copies. It is recommended to print the document double-sided unless otherwise indicated. Depending on the number of pages, the document must be stapled or bound (ring-bound).

The student must sign the submission form. Since the dissertation jury must normally have already been formed prior to submission, the TGDE may distribute the copies to the jury members without delay. To avoid any oversights, the verification grid intended for students submitting their master's thesis (Appendix E1) can be used.

### M Time required for thesis evaluation
The time required for thesis evaluation is a maximum of 30 clear days (RP-ESP, art. 90). This period is normally sufficient to allow the jury to deliberate, make its decision, and report.

### T Initial submission of the thesis and related forms
The procedure for the initial submission of theses is less formalized than that for the final submission. However, certain general instructions must be followed to preserve the adequacy and integrity of the jury's evaluation process.

The initial submission of the thesis and all related forms is made to the office of the program in which the student is enrolled. The student must be enrolled in their program at the time of submission. In the rare cases where an initial paper submission is requested, five printed copies of the thesis (plus a sixth copy if there is a co-supervisor) are required. The student is responsible for printing the required number of copies. It is recommended to print the document double-sided, unless otherwise indicated. Depending on the number of pages, the document must be stapled or bound (ring-bound).

The student must sign the submission form. Since the thesis committee must normally have been formed prior to submission, the TGDE will distribute the copies to the committee members without delay. To ensure no oversights, the verification grid for students submitting their doctoral thesis (Appendix F1) may be used.

### T The External Examiner's Report
After receiving the thesis, the external examiner normally has four to five weeks to evaluate it and write their report. Once completed, they send the chairperson their summary report, detailed evaluation, and correction requests, along with a copy of the thesis, if applicable.

### T Total time required for thesis evaluation
The maximum time for thesis evaluation is 90 clear days (RP-ESP, art. 137). This period is normally sufficient to allow the jury to deliberate, make its decision, and report.

### MT MT Instructions for initial electronic submission
Jury members may request, at their convenience, to receive the dissertation or thesis in paper or electronic format. When electronic format is chosen, the student may not send the electronic file(s) directly to the jury members. The files must be sent through the unit's secretariat, which liaises with the jury members. The file type used should ideally allow for the entry of comments and notes. The file annotated by each evaluator is returned to the chairperson along with the duly completed evaluation report.

### Final Submission of Dissertations and Theses
Since 2009, the final submission of dissertations and theses has been done electronically on the Papyrus institutional repository website. This publicly accessible site is indexed by catalogs and search engines, contributing to the visibility of both the authors and the institution concerned.

## REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES FOR FINAL SUBMISSION
All information regarding the final submission process in Papyrus is presented in the theses section of the libraries' website. Submitted files must meet the technical requirements stated on the site; otherwise, the submitted document will be returned to the student for adjustments. For students in art history, film studies, and music, special submission conditions apply. It is important to check with the TGDE of the relevant unit.

It is essential to carefully check the content integrity and language quality of the submitted document, as once the final submission is complete, no further changes or corrections can be made.

Any modification request for exceptional reasons must be submitted in writing to the VRAESP for approval.

Students are responsible for obtaining all necessary copyright permissions before their manuscript is uploaded electronically to the institutional website, particularly if the manuscript consists of co-authored articles (see Appendix A). Students must keep a copy of these permissions so they can be produced if necessary.

Reference aids are provided in Appendix E2 (dissertations) and Appendix F2 (theses).

## LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT
Upon final submission to Papyrus, the student grants only a non-exclusive license to distribute their document to the Université de Montréal. They always retain copyright to their manuscript.

## DISSEMINATION OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES
The Université de Montréal places great importance on the public dissemination of research results.

Dissertations and theses produced at the Université de Montréal are uploaded to Papyrus, the institutional repository. In this regard, to ensure the educational objectives are met, students should avoid choosing a project whose results must remain confidential or be reserved for third-party use.

In exceptional cases, research requirements may justify recognizing the confidentiality of certain dissertations and theses, or applying a dissemination embargo for a specific period. In such circumstances, the student may avail themselves of one of the following two mechanisms established by the institution.

### Request for confidentiality of a dissertation or thesis
The student may, for serious reasons, wish to have their dissertation or thesis confidential. To request this, they must complete the confidentiality request form. The main accepted reasons are a commercial confidentiality agreement or a patent application. Confidentiality means that neither the document itself nor its description (author, title, abstract, etc.) are made available in any way whatsoever before the end of the confidentiality period. This period is for a maximum of one year, renewable only once. Once the confidentiality period has ended, the document is added to the Papyrus institutional repository. To obtain confidentiality, the student must obtain the agreement of their program director upon recommendation from their research supervisor.

### Request for a Dissertation or Thesis Release
Students may request, for serious reasons, a release period (embargo) for their dissertation or thesis. They must complete the appropriate form. This request can be made upon final submission, before the manuscript is added to the Papyrus institutional repository. The main reason for an embargo request is generally a publisher's requirement related to the publication of articles or a book based on the dissertation or thesis. In the case of an embargo, unlike confidentiality, although the manuscript itself will not be released, the metadata related to its description (author, title, abstract, etc.) will. The release period can be set at 6 months, 1, 2, or 5 years. At the end of the embargo period, the document will become available in the Papyrus institutional repository. To obtain a release period, students must obtain the consent of their research supervisor. For a subsequent withdrawal, the student must obtain the consent of the Associate Vice-President of Graduate Studies.

The request for confidentiality or a delayed release does not affect the normal course of the evaluation process by a panel of professors, whose members, however, undertake in writing to respect the confidentiality of the document submitted to them for evaluation.

It is important to note that confidentiality and a delayed release are two mutually exclusive options that cannot be combined.

## PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION TIME
The electronic submission validation process generally takes only a few days. If a problem is identified at either of these stages, the student will be notified by email. Students should not hesitate to contact the TGDE of the relevant unit to follow up on the submission if they feel the delays are unusually long. It should be noted that the thesis or dissertation is only published on Papyrus once the degree has been granted by the University. Therefore, an average of six months (and a maximum of ten months) should be allowed between the time of final submission and the student receiving the email notification indicating that the document is now available online.

Finally, it should be noted that in addition to being available on Papyrus, theses and dissertations are listed in the Sofia search tool and in the Theses Canada portal of Library and Archives Canada.
