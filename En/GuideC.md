# SECTION C – WRITING AND PRESENTATION OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES

## PLANNING THE WRITING
The dissertation or thesis reports in whole or in part on the research conducted by the student and constitutes a document intended for the scientific community. Those who consult it will be able to appreciate its value and originality. Aware of these issues, the serious and responsible student will want their dissertation or thesis to be considered a credible, easily readable, and convincing document. To achieve this goal, the manuscript must be carefully prepared, according to the highest standards of presentation and writing. The most sought-after qualities are undoubtedly the following:

## PRESENTATION AND WRITING STANDARDS.
* Clarity, readability, and precision. Any reader of the dissertation or thesis will want to find clear, precise, and easy-to-understand ideas and arguments. The contribution to the advancement of knowledge should be explicitly and convincingly demonstrated.

* Quality of presentation and writing. To present a quality manuscript, students should rely on a few recent examples of the best theses or dissertations produced in their field of research or a related field.
* Conciseness. The considerable volume of scientific documents to be consulted leaves little time for any potential reader of the dissertation or thesis. A simple and concise manuscript is much more likely to be consulted and appreciated than a wordy and overly voluminous document.

When planning the writing of their manuscript, students should, in close consultation with their research supervisor, consider the following questions:

Will the research work conducted and the results obtained allow for the writing of a manuscript that meets the requirements of the program2 in which I am enrolled?

The jury will provide the final answer to this question, but it is in the student's best interest to aim as accurately as possible in light of the training objectives of the master's or doctoral program. If necessary, they should seek assistance from the program directors. If the content is deemed insufficient by the jury, the dissertation or thesis risks being returned for major revisions or being rejected. Conversely, one must avoid attempting to create a magnum opus, which risks penalizing the student by requiring too much work and an excessively long study period.

What is the most appropriate format for presenting the dissertation or thesis given my research project: monographic, article-based, or other?

This question is important because the main advantage of presenting the dissertation in articles is the rapid and targeted dissemination of research results and the immediate recognition of a contribution to the advancement of knowledge. The major challenge with the article-based format is the difficulty of writing a dissertation or thesis manuscript that forms a coherent and well-integrated whole and of clearly identifying, where applicable, the student's personal contribution to the writing of the articles.

Once the format of presentation has been chosen, how should the dissertation or thesis be structured and the text (if applicable) drafted to meet the highest quality standards?

> 2. It is essential to check with the program director whether a specific guide or guidelines have been published for the program in question.

This dimension is of paramount importance to the jury, as it reveals the quality of the student's training, beyond the purely scientific and technical aspects of the course. The author's intellectual abilities are reflected in the originality, clarity, and precision of the text, but also in the quality of the language, the care taken in its presentation, and the conciseness of the document. This training is acquired through study and practice. Students should consult the best references on the subject and rely on excellent recent dissertation or thesis models in their field of study.

## PRESENTATION STANDARDS
All dissertations and theses must comply with standards regarding their constituent elements and format, designed to harmonize and facilitate the presentation of dissertations and theses at the Université de Montréal. Students must also take into account, where applicable, certain specific requirements specific to their discipline or field of study.

All conditions regarding the mandatory constituent elements and the format of the document must be met for it to be sent to the committee members. Otherwise, it will be returned to the student for corrections or changes, and the evaluation process will be delayed accordingly.

The reader will find some formatting rules and recommendations in Appendix D of this guide.

## Constituent Elements of the Dissertation or Thesis
The description of the constituent elements of the dissertation or thesis covers the meaning and order of the various parts of the work. The various elements to be considered3 are listed in the following table (in the order of presentation) and defined below. Careful attention must be paid to all mandatory sections, and the student is required to follow all the following guidelines.

† This element must only be included if the document is written in a language other than English or French.

> 3. Depending on the chosen dissertation or thesis format, some elements may not be relevant. Here, we list the elements for documents whose content is primarily textual.

## Title Page
A standard title page is presented in Appendix B. If the language of writing is other than French, the title page must still be written in French, with the exception of the title of the dissertation or thesis.

The copyright notice (the letter C inside a circle: ©) must appear on the title page to indicate that the copyright belongs to the student submitting the work.

The title is a phrase or short sentence not ending with a period, which must provide precise and relevant information about the content of the work. It is generally composed of no more than 15 words, totaling no more than 175 characters (including spaces and punctuation). A title that is too long may be cut off in a catalog or search engine, thus losing its coherence for the reader. The author of the dissertation or thesis therefore has every interest in choosing a title of appropriate length to ensure the best possible identification and visibility of their work.

The title must include the normally required punctuation marks and not be written in all capital letters.

Instead, it must comply with the grammatical and editorial standards of the language in which it is written. A subtitle may be added to the title proper. This subtitle is positioned below the title proper with a distinct typography (e.g., in italics).

It is very important to note that the date (month, year) on the title page must correspond to the date of the initial submission, unless there have been major corrections, in which case it must correspond to the date of the second submission.

The Jury Members' Identification Page
A page identifying the jury members is inserted after the title page, unless, in the case of master's theses, the jury has expressly requested that the page be removed upon final submission. This information should be verified with the TGDE (Executive Director of the Department of Evaluation and Evaluation), who will find this information in point 3 of the jury evaluation form. Sample jury identification pages are presented in Appendix H.

Abstract and Keywords in French
The abstract in French is always mandatory, regardless of the language in which the dissertation or thesis is written. It must be precise, informative, and concise. It should generally allow the reader to understand how the dissertation or thesis is structured, how the topic is approached, the main results obtained, and what significant conclusions are drawn. The abstract should not exceed 250 words (1 page) for a master's thesis and 500 words (2 pages) for a doctoral thesis.

Keywords (maximum ten) must accompany the abstract to facilitate indexing of the work.
These are selected based on their relevance and the terminology currently used in the field of study. These terms will enhance the visibility of the dissertation or thesis, as they will facilitate its discovery in bibliographic databases and on the web.

Abstract and Keywords in English

Since English is the most important international language of scientific and technical communication, optimal inclusion and retrieval of a work in Papyrus, international databases, and web search engines requires an abstract and keywords in English. This abstract and keywords must comply with the standards described above that apply to the abstract and keywords in French.

Students must include an abstract in English and provide English keywords, regardless of the language in which their work was written. The program director may waive this requirement for valid reasons. If applicable, a note to this effect must be included in the dissertation or thesis.

Abstract in a language other than English or French

When the dissertation or thesis is written in a language other than French or English, an abstract in the language in which it was written is also required. This abstract must comply with the standards that apply to abstracts in French.

Popular Abstract of a Doctoral Thesis

Such an abstract is optional. Its purpose is to disseminate the research results to the public through the media. Its content will provide accurate information and rigorous interpretations of the research, paying appropriate attention to the ethical dimensions of the research and, where applicable, to the rules relating to the use of laboratory animals and research with human subjects. It will be written in close collaboration with the research supervisor, according to the quality standards applicable to all popular work: providing context, formulating a clear message, using simple and appropriate language, etc. The summary may be written in French or English and should not exceed two pages (maximum 500 words). It will be evaluated by the jury for its quality and accuracy.

Table of contents, list of tables, figures, and other special documents

These elements are distinct sections and each should be presented on separate, clearly identified pages. The table of contents and the lists of tables and figures should ideally be automatically generated by a feature of the word processing software and should include dynamic cross-references to the pages where the elements are found in the body of the text. Within the text, each element (table, figure, etc.) should be numbered with Arabic numerals. In the rare cases where the initial submission is in paper format, certain documents (graphs, diagrams, maps, photos, films, sound recordings, etc.) which, due to their size or format, are included in a pocket at the end of the work or separately, should be identified in the lists of figures and tables. During the final electronic submission, some of these special documents (photos, maps, etc.) may be included in the thesis or dissertation file itself in PDF format. Other types of files (multimedia files, programs) must be submitted as separate files. In both cases, the work must include a list of these special documents, whether or not they are included in the main PDF file. For information on file formats, it is important to consult the libraries' website. Please note that students must only submit multimedia files or programs that have been evaluated by the committee members.

List of Acronyms and Abbreviations

Acronyms and abbreviations must be used with caution and in accordance with generally accepted rules. They should be presented at the beginning of the work in alphabetical order, indicating their meaning.

Dedication
This is a short tribute paid by the author to individuals of their choice. This addition is optional, but permitted.

Acknowledgments
Acknowledgments represent an expression of appreciation or gratitude to individuals or organizations and may be required of the donor or funding agency.

Foreword
The foreword serves to outline the author's reasons for choosing a research topic and the approach used to address it. It helps situate the work within the context of the discipline or field of study.

The Body of the Work
This is made up of the various chapters or constituent elements of the dissertation or thesis, which form the bulk of the document. The choice of headings and subheadings should allow for a clear understanding of the coherence and relevance of the proposed development. In the case of a presentation by article, offprints, photocopies of articles, or electronic versions formatted by the publisher are not acceptable. These texts are generally single-spaced and in small print, not to mention that the publisher generally holds the copyright to the published version, which cannot be reproduced without permission.

The student must present the original manuscript of each article in the same format as the written chapters of the dissertation or thesis.

Indexes

Their purpose is to allow for quick identification of important elements mentioned in the work, particularly authors' names and key concepts. Bibliographic References

The way you present citations and bibliographic references in a work depends on the bibliographic style used in your field of study or required by your department. To learn about the main bibliographic styles used in the various departments at UdeM, consult this page. Among the most recognized styles are APA, Chicago, Vancouver, and MLA.

Note that the work of compiling and formatting bibliographic references can be greatly facilitated by using bibliographic software such as Endnote or Zotero, for which UdeM Libraries offer support and training.

Appendices
When the dissertation or thesis includes certain data documents, questionnaires, long calculations, advanced demonstrations, or special documents (films, musical scores, etc.), for the sake of readability, these elements may be included in appendices placed in the body of the work.

At the time of final submission, appendices must be included in the same file as the main body of the work, except for audio files, video files, executable files such as 3D simulations, or very high-resolution image files (e.g., maps). In this case, these files must be submitted to Papyrus as supplemental files to the main PDF file. For information on what must be included in the main PDF file and what can be submitted as supplemental files, please refer to the instructions on the libraries' website.

Document Formatting

All formal requirements must be met for the presentation of the dissertation or thesis, as explained in Appendix C. Particular attention will be paid to the following elements:
* Page format and margins.
* Text production and layout.
* Section numbering and pagination.
* Line spacing, spacing, and citations.
* Illustrations, tables, and figures.

If the members of the evaluation committee specifically request printed copies, they must be submitted with, at a minimum, a ring-bound binding and a hardcover.

Normally, the International System of Units (SI) must be used for the presentation of quantitative or numerical data (see Appendix D). Students should be aware that dissertation and thesis manuscripts are distributed as received: there is no additional formatting or revision. This is why it is essential to ensure the proper presentation of the manuscript upon final submission.

It is the student's responsibility to ensure the quality of the language in their manuscript, including compliance with the rules of syntax, spelling, punctuation, proper use of upper and lower case letters, and the absence of typos. Dissertation and thesis manuscripts cannot be modified after their final submission. If necessary, before making their final submission, students may use the services and tools provided by the University for writing, such as the resources of the Bureau du français dans les études5, online dictionaries and translation tools, and the Antidote proofreader available on library computers. Finally, students may also use the private services of a linguistic editor to ensure the formal integrity of their manuscript. In such a context, however, external assistance must be limited to a single revision of the form and not a rewrite. The manuscript that is submitted must faithfully and solely reflect the research and reflection work carried out by the student.
